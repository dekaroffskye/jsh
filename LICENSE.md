#### Licensing Information
We offer a commercial BSD Like, 2-Clause contributary license for four reasons:

>**1.** Entities who have made considerable contributions to this work with,
permisive licensing shall not be denied the right to prosper from this work.

>**2.** Anyone who is creating a commercial product, shall be able to use our
software, but will also share in the financial responsibilty of its development.

>**3.** Bearing the financial duties should mean gaining the rights, to a
marketable advantage.

>**4.** Anything less, would be uncivilized.

<br/>
Following is a list of commercially qualified entities with their respective
contribution(s) to this work:

* Apple Inc. (JavaScriptCore)
* Dyncall.org (Dyncall Library)
* GitHub Inc. (Code Hosting)
* Gnome.org (Seed Project)

If you are interested in purchasing a contributary license, or becoming a
contributor, contact the respective project maintainer.

Due to the fact that we cannot relicense GPL'd code, GPL'd code submissions,
cannot be incorporated into a contributary project. LGPL'd libraries are the
only acceptable form of GPL'd code integration for the main project at this time.

The contributary 2-Clause, by which all upstream code submissions must adhere
to, ensures that a contributors code is in fact GPL compatible. This is a method
to ensure that we have a well defined cross-licensing, cross-platform solution to
provide to the general public as well as the project contributors.

If you would like to make a $25.00 donation, please contact the author for
information as to where you can send your donation via snail mail. If you would
like to make a smaller donation, please send your money to a reputable charity
organization that could actually do something with it, such as
[The American Red Cross](http://www.redcross.org),
[The Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donation), or
[The Free Software Foundation](http://www.fsf.org).

Thank you.
