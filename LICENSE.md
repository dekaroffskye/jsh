#### Licensing Information
We offer a
[commercial BSD Like, 2-Clause contributary license](share/docs/LICENSE/Hypersoft-Contributary.md)
for four reasons:

>**1.** Entities who have made considerable contributions to this work with,
permisive licensing shall not be denied the right to prosper from this work.

>**2.** Anyone who is creating a commercial product, shall be able to use our
software, but will also share in the financial responsibilty of its development.

>**3.** Bearing the financial duties should mean gaining the rights, to a
marketable advantage.

>**4.** Anything less, would be uncivilized.

<br/>
We offer a
[Free Software License](share/docs/LICENSE/GPLV3.md) for quite a few reasons.
The primary being, there's no reason we cannot be civil. 
What this boils down to is the specialization of technology. All advances and 
fields of science may not be willing or able to release gainful research during
development and lifecycle. Our licensing hopes to be a bridge for that common
interest where sharing is truly meaningful and available.

Following is a list of commercially qualified entities with their respective
contribution(s) to this work:

* Apple Inc. (JavaScriptCore)
* Dyncall.org (Dyncall Library)
* GitHub Inc. (Code Hosting)
* Gnome.org (Seed Project)

If you are interested in purchasing a contributary license, or becoming a
contributor, contact the respective project maintainer.

Due to the fact that we cannot relicense GPL'd code, GPL'd code submissions,
cannot be incorporated into a contributary project. LGPL'd libraries are the
only acceptable form of GPL'd code integration for the main project at this time.

The contributary 2-Clause, by which all upstream code submissions must adhere
to, ensures that a contributors code is in fact GPL compatible. This is a method
to ensure that we have a well defined cross-licensing, cross-platform solution to
provide to the general public as well as the project contributors.

If you would like to make a $25.00 donation, please contact the author for
information as to where you can send your donation via snail mail. If you would
like to make a smaller donation, please send your money to a reputable charity
organization that could actually do something with it, such as
[The American Red Cross](http://www.redcross.org),
[The Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donation), or
[The Free Software Foundation](http://www.fsf.org).

Thank you.
